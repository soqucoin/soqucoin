## Executive Summary

Stage 5 is a **research initiative** exploring quantum-safe Layer 2 payment channels built on 
Soqucoin's L1 settlement layer. Inspired by Bitcoin's Lightning Network, we're investigating:

- **Sub-second payments** (design target: <500ms)
- **High throughput** (theoretical target: 10,000+ TPS)
- **Quantum-resistant channels** (Dilithium commitment signatures)
- **Privacy by default** (channel state is off-chain)

### Research vs Engineering Distinction

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **What we have** | Production L1 with Dilithium, functional single-hop ELTOO channels on Stagenet, QR-based state exchange, CTV + CSV covenant opcodes active |
| **What we're researching** | Multi-hop routing, adaptor signature alternatives for lattice-based schemes |
| **What's unsolved** | PQ adaptor signatures, channel state aggregation across multi-hop paths |
| **Our approach** | ELTOO state supersession (no watchtowers, no penalty txs), adapt BOLT specs where possible |

---

## Motivation

### L1 Limitations

| Metric | L1 (All Stages) | Requirement for Payments |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| TPS | ~40-70 | 10,000+ |
| Confirmation | 60 seconds | <1 second |
| Fees | ~0.01 SOQ | <0.0001 SOQ |
| Privacy | Opt-in (on-chain visible) | Default private |

### Why L2 is Necessary

1. **Block size/time constraints**: L1 TPS is fundamentally limited by 4MB blocks and 60-second target
2. **Payment UX**: Users expect instant confirmations for retail transactions
3. **Micropayments**: On-chain fees prohibit sub-cent transactions
4. **Scalability ceiling**: Mainnet adoption will exceed L1 capacity

### Why Now (After Stage 4)

| Prerequisite | Stage | Rationale |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| Dilithium signatures | Genesis | L2 channels must use PQ signatures |
| LatticeFold+ verification | Stage 2 | Efficient batch settlement of channel closes |
| Full PQ privacy | Stage 3 | End-to-end quantum-safe privacy |
| Liquidity bridge | Stage 4 | Cross-chain liquidity for channel funding |

## Open Research Challenges

> [!WARNING]
> **Unsolved Problems**
> The following challenges do not have known solutions in the post-quantum cryptography literature.
> Our research timeline is contingent on making progress on these problems.

### 1. Post-Quantum Adaptor Signatures

**Problem**: Bitcoin Lightning uses Schnorr adaptor signatures for atomic multi-hop payments (PTLCs).
Dilithium does not natively support adaptor signatures.

**Status**: Active research  
**Approaches under investigation**:
- Hash-based HTLC alternatives (proven but less efficient)
- Exploring lattice-based adaptor constructions from academic literature
- Hybrid approaches using hash-time-locked commitments

**References**:
- Erwig et al., "Two-Party Adaptor Signatures From Identification Schemes" (2021)
- Tairi et al., "Post-Quantum Adaptor Signature" (2023, preprint)

### 2. Channel State Size

**Problem**: Dilithium signatures are 2,420 bytes (vs 64 bytes for Schnorr). Each channel state
update requires signatures from both parties, accumulating storage and bandwidth costs.

**Status**: Exploring solutions  
**Potential mitigations**:
- Signature aggregation (research needed)
- State compression via LatticeFold+ proofs
- Periodic state consolidation

**Impact**: May limit practical channel update frequency compared to Bitcoin LN.

### 3. Route Finding

**Problem**: Large keys and signatures affect channel capacity variance and gossip protocol
bandwidth. Network topology may differ significantly from Bitcoin Lightning.

**Status**: Under analysis  
**Open questions**:
- Optimal channel capacity sizes with PQ overhead
- Gossip protocol modifications for larger announcements
- Pathfinding algorithm adaptations

---

## Technical Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Quantum-safe from genesis**: All channel operations use Dilithium signatures
2. **ELTOO state supersession**: Latest state always wins; no penalty transactions, no watchtowers
3. **Covenant-enabled**: CTV (0xb3) + CSV (0xb2) opcodes active from L1 genesis
4. **L1 settlement efficiency**: LatticeFold+ for batch channel settlements
5. **Privacy preservation**: Channel state never touches L1 during normal operation

```

### Channel Lifecycle

#### 1. Channel Open (On-Chain)
```
Alice → L1 Transaction:
  - Output: 2-of-2 Dilithium multisig P2WSH (witness v6)
  - CTV covenant hash locks spend template
  - Value: X SOQ locked (min 100 SOQ)
  - Channel ID: SHA-256("L2SOQ-CHAN-V1" || sort(pkA, pkB) || capacity)
```

#### 2. Off-Chain Payments (Instant)
```
Alice → Bob (off-chain):
  - State Update: New balance distribution
  - Signed: ML-DSA-44 (both parties)
  - State #N supersedes all prior states (ELTOO)
  - No revocation needed

Payment latency: <500ms (measured on Stagenet)
Fees: 0 SOQ (off-chain)
```

#### 3. Channel Close (On-Chain)
```
Cooperative Close:
  - Latest state → L1
  - LatticeFold+ batch verification (if multiple channels)

Force Close (ELTOO):
  - Broadcast latest state + CSV timelock (144 blocks, ~2.4 hours)
  - Counterparty can publish newer state during timelock
  - No watchtower needed — any party can publish latest state
```

### Quantum-Safe Adaptations

| Lightning (Bitcoin) | L2SOQ | Rationale |
|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| ECDSA signatures | Dilithium ML-DSA-44 | Quantum resistance |
| SHA-256 HTLCs | SHA-256 HTLCs | SHA-256 is PQ-safe |
| Penalty-based revocation | **ELTOO state supersession** | No watchtowers, simpler security model |
| 71-byte signatures | 2,420-byte signatures | Larger but acceptable for L2 |
| Requires watchtowers | **No watchtowers** | ELTOO eliminates third-party monitors |

> [!NOTE]
> ELTOO's state supersession model means the latest state always wins. This eliminates:
> - Revocation keys and the complexity of penalty transactions
> - Watchtower infrastructure and its associated bandwidth/storage costs
> - The risk of accidental old-state broadcasts resulting in fund loss
>
> This is enabled by CTV (`OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`, 0xb3) for covenant hash commitment
> and CSV (`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`, 0xb2) for relative timelocks on dispute windows.

// SoquObscura — per-asset issuer key registry (WI-2)
//
// =============================================================================
// STATUS: SCAFFOLDING. Not in Makefile.am, not included by any consensus path.
// Plan:   doc/design/DL-SOQUOBSCURA-VE-CONSENSUS-PLAN.md section 3a
// Review: doc/design/DL-SOQUOBSCURA-ISSUER-KEY-REVIEW.md
// Bead:   soqucoin-build-soquobscura-ve-wi1-wi2-4xiq
// =============================================================================
//
// ⛔ MODEL STATUS: PROPOSED, NOT RATIFIED. This is decision gate D2 and it is
// OPEN. An earlier revision of this header said "Casey-decided 2026-08-16";
// no such ratification is recorded in any design document, and the companion
// review (DL-SOQUOBSCURA-ISSUER-KEY-REVIEW.md) states on its own first page
// that it reviews a *proposal* and is "an analytical device, not a record of
// real people's review". The claim has been withdrawn. This is the same defect
// class as the witness-v6 collision: an artifact asserting a fact that no
// source supports, which a later reader then builds on. Do not restore an
// authority claim here without a dated ratification you can cite.
//
// PROPOSED MODEL (gate D2): per-asset key registry, epoch-addressed, rotation
// authority split from the decryption key, storing a typed key DESCRIPTOR
// rather than a raw public key.
//
// WHY A DESCRIPTOR RATHER THAN A KEY
//
// The ratified post-launch enhancement is a threshold (t-of-n) issuer key so
// that no single party can decrypt the ledger. That upgrade is cheap here, and
// the reason is worth recording because the whole design leans on it:
//
//   the verifiable-encryption public key is t_v = A_v * s_v + e_v
//
// A threshold scheme shares the PRIVATE s_v across n parties. It does not
// change t_v, does not change the ciphertext shape, and does not change the
// relation. Consensus verifies the VE proof and never performs a decryption,
// so single-key -> threshold is a change in who holds s_v plus a new descriptor
// type. It is NOT a consensus change and NOT a wire-format break.
// (Confirmed against VE-V2-CARD.md line 41 and the phase-2 verifier signature.)
//
// SECURITY PROPERTY THIS MODEL DOES *NOT* PROVIDE, stated so nobody banks it:
// epoch rotation limits FUTURE exposure only. A decryption key that leaks
// exposes every amount ever encrypted to it, retroactively and permanently.
// Rotation does not mitigate exfiltration; only threshold access and
// distributed custody do. See the review, finding A2.

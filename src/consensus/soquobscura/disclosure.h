// SoquObscura — mandatory issuer disclosure for confidential outputs
//
// =============================================================================
// STATUS: SCAFFOLDING. Deliberately NOT in Makefile.am and NOT included by any
// consensus path. Nothing here affects validation until WI-2 and WI-3 land.
// Plan: doc/design/DL-SOQUOBSCURA-VE-CONSENSUS-PLAN.md
// Bead: soqucoin-build-soquobscura-ve-wi1-wi2-4xiq
// =============================================================================
//
// WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT ViewKeyData
//
// The ratified Tier A compliance rule (DL-LATTICEBP-STATE-ANALYSIS-2026-07-18
// section II.3, Casey-ratified 2026-07-19) requires that every confidential
// USDSOQ output carry the amount and blinding encrypted to the issuer's view
// key, together with an in-band proof, verified by consensus, that the
// ciphertext encrypts exactly the committed value. Consensus rejects a
// confidential USDSOQ output without one. That rule is what makes issuer audit,
// the proof-of-reserves turnstile, regulator disclosure, the Travel Rule and
// GENIUS Act 4(a)(2) freeze compatibility true statements rather than
// intentions.
//
// The pre-existing consensus/privacy.h ViewKeyData is NOT that mechanism and is
// scheduled for deletion (WI-4):
//
//   - it is documented as OPTIONAL, so it has no compliance force;
//   - it is referenced by nothing in the validation path;
//   - it carries no proof of correct encryption, only a 32-byte commitment
//     hint an auditor can check AFTER decrypting, which consensus cannot use
//     because consensus never decrypts;
//   - it encrypts under ChaCha20-Poly1305 with a key from HKDF over a
//     Diffie-Hellman shared secret. The symmetric part is fine; the key
//     agreement is classically breakable, which makes it a
//     harvest-now-decrypt-later hole inside a post-quantum chain.
//
// This structure replaces it wholesale, as the scope document directs, with the
// Module-LWE verifiable encryption already built and measured in phase 3
// (22,426 B wire, prove 104.0 ms, verify 56.9 ms, MLWE 2^164.2 at k_dim = 12).
//
// DISAMBIGUATION, because both have been confused before:
//   - the ViewKey in crypto/latticebp/stealth_address.h is the Monero-style
//     RECIPIENT SCANNING key, from the superseded design;
//   - the issuer view key here is the mandatory Tier A COMPLIANCE key.
// Different objects. Do not conflate them.

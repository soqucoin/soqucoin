// PAT block attestation (SOQ-P001, phase 3 of the PAT completion epic).
//
// Specification: doc/PAT_BLOCK_ATTESTATION.md. Every rule this module
// implements is defined there; this header cites sections rather than
// restating them. The attestation is recomputed independently by every node
// and compared byte-for-byte against the miner's coinbase commitment, so
// every function here must be a total, deterministic function of its inputs.
//
// This module is deliberately free of chain state. Callers (the miner's
// commitment producer and ConnectBlock's validator) supply the prevout lookup
// and the activation facts; the module never consults globals. That keeps the
// computation testable in isolation and keeps both callers on one code path,
// which is the property that prevents producer/validator drift.

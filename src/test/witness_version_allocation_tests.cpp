// witness_version_allocation_tests.cpp — the witness-version allocation table,
// derived from script/interpreter.cpp and pinned across every layer that holds
// an opinion about it. Bead v7xm, fork-risk class F2.
//
// ⛔ DERIVE THE TABLE FROM interpreter.cpp, NEVER FROM A DESIGN DOCUMENT. That
// instruction is on the bead because it has already cost us once: confidential
// USDSOQ was allocated witness v6 while v6 was ALREADY P2WSH-Dilithium, and the
// two predicates were byte-for-byte identical. It was green in CI, because
// nothing compared the two layers. It moved to v10.
//
// FOUR LAYERS INDEPENDENTLY ENCODE THIS TABLE, and they can drift apart in
// silence because no single compilation unit sees more than one of them:
//
//   1. script/interpreter.cpp   VerifyScript's shape predicates and their flag
//                               gates. AUTHORITATIVE: this decides whether a
//                               coin can actually be spent.
//   2. script/standard.cpp      Solver's txnouttype. Decides whether an output
//                               has a name, which is a precondition for relay.
//   3. validation.cpp/policy.cpp  the activeWitnessVersions mask. Decides
//                               whether a NAMED version relays right now.
//   4. primitives/transaction.h asset/visibility predicates. Decides what a
//                               consensus rule in validation.cpp thinks the
//                               output IS.
//
// A version can be allocated in one and absent from another, and every such gap
// is a real behaviour with no test behind it. The tests below assert the whole
// grid rather than one row at a time, so any layer moving on its own fails here.
//
// Policy-side behaviour has its own suite (witness_standardness_tests.cpp). This
// one exists for the SCRIPT side and for the cross-layer agreement, which is
// where the v6 collision lived and where nothing was looking.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WITNESS v3 / LatticeFold+ IS RETIRED, ON EVERY NETWORK.
//
// Superseded by SoquObscura. The verifier reads its own statement fields out of
// the untrusted proof blob and every algebraic check is homogeneous in the
// witness, so an all-zero witness satisfies all of them: a proof carrying no
// valid signature verifies. Mainnet withdrew it; testnet, regtest and stagenet
// were left ALWAYS_ACTIVE and therefore validated under a rule mainnet refuses,
// which is the same state bead 2pru withdrew SoquObscura from and the same
// reasoning. Retired on all four as of 2026-08-20.
//
// "Retired" is enforced here rather than asserted in a comment, because the
// entire lesson of this sweep is that an intention nothing executes is
// indistinguishable from an intention nobody implemented.
//
// ⛔ v3 MUST NOT BE REALLOCATED. It is deliberately left in the anyone-can-spend
// soft-fork posture rather than turned into a hard script error, which keeps
// both future options open: burning it later is a tightening (a soft fork, still
// available), whereas un-burning it would be a hard fork. Reuse is nonetheless
// the wrong move — v11-v16 are free, so there is no scarcity pressure, and a
// number that meant "LatticeFold+ batch proof" for a year will stay wrong in
// somebody's explorer, SDK or document. That is the confusion class that produced
// the v6 collision. Allocate upward from v11.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⛔⛔ SOQ-I011 TRIPWIRE. SoquObscura must stay NOT_SCHEDULED on every network
// until the range-proof verifier is made sound. Setting an activation height
// here is the single action that converts a dormant unsoundness into live
// inflation, so it must fail loudly rather than quietly work.
//
// The verifier does not bind the committed amount, and the reason is NOT the
// no-op at Check 5:
//
//   * Check 4 compares a PROVER-SUPPLIED t_reconstruction against
//     z_response*A + z_randomness*S. Both sides are prover-controlled and the
//     relation is homogeneous, so (z, z_r, t) = (0, 0, 0) with an honest
//     Fiat-Shamir seed satisfies it. The SOQ-D001 comment claiming
//     Schwartz-Zippel binding is an assertion, not a proof. Filling in Check 5
//     as an upper bound would still accept z_randomness = 0.
//   * On the OPCODE path it is worse. interpreter.cpp default-constructs
//     `latticebp::RangeProofParams rp_params;` and RingElement's default ctor
//     zero-fills, so A and S are all-zero and Check 4 collapses to
//     t_reconstruction == 0 independent of the responses. Any blob with a
//     zero t and a matching seed verifies, and the seed is computable from
//     public data alone.
//   * Root cause: `consensus.latticeBPSeed` is set twelve times in
//     chainparams.cpp and read NOWHERE. LatticeCommitment::PublicParams::
//     generate() has no consensus caller at all. The generators the verifier
//     needs are never derived, so the opcode path was never going to bind.
//
// The three deliberate failures in soquobscura_degenerate_witness_tests.cpp
// are the live demonstration of this and must NOT be "fixed" by patching the
// symptom. Correct order of work: seed PublicParams from consensus.
// latticeBPSeed, make Check 4 bind against a verifier-derived value, then
// Check 5, then re-run the forgery battery, then consider a height.

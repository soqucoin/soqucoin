## About

Soqucoin is a Scrypt-based proof-of-work cryptocurrency that removes ECDSA from the transaction authorization path and uses **NIST-standardized ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium)** signatures. It uses **PAT** (Practical Attestation Technique) for batch signature attestation. **SoquObscura**, the post-quantum confidential transaction system built on the LNP22/LaZer proof system with LaBRADOR block-level aggregation, is designed and partly in-tree but is **not activated on any network**. See the status note in the Architecture section before citing any of its figures.

> **Why does this matter?** Quantum computers will eventually break ECDSA. Soqucoin makes all user transaction signatures quantum-resistant without requiring a soft-fork migration from an ECDSA-based design.

## Features

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

| Component | Implementation | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Signatures** | ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | NIST Level 2 (128-bit quantum) |
| **Address Hashing** | SHA-256 | 128-bit collision |
| **Batch Verification** | PAT (Merkle-aggregated) | Constant-size proofs |
| **Proof-of-Work** | Scrypt (N=1024, r=1, p=1) | Grover: quadratic speedup only |

### Confidential Transactions: SoquObscura (SOQ-P010)

> **STATUS: NOT ACTIVE ON ANY NETWORK.** `DEPLOYMENT_SOQUOBSCURA` is
> `NOT_SCHEDULED` on mainnet, testnet, regtest and stagenet, and its BIP9 entry
> is configured to never activate. The table below describes the **design**, not
> behaviour you can observe on a running node. The reference sizes and timings
> are measured against the research implementation, not against consensus code.
> Confidential outputs do not currently hide amounts.

| Component | Implementation | Security Level |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Commitments** | ABDLOP (R = Z_{12289}[X]/(X^64+1)) | NIST Category 2 (quantum-safe) |
| **Range Proofs** | LNP22 exact-binary extraction | NIST Category 2 (quantum-safe) |
| **Balance Proofs** | Corrector-chain with shift-shadow boundary pin | NIST Category 2 (quantum-safe) |
| **Verifiable Encryption** | Dual-target Module-LPR (issuer + recipient) | NIST Category 2 (quantum-safe) |
| **Block Aggregation** | LaBRADOR pack proofs (single q = 2^38 − 107) | Constant-size per block |
| **Ref Tx Size** | ~146 KB (2 range + 1 balance + 4 VE) | — |
| **Ref Verify Time** | 316 ms (single-thread, Xeon 8358, AVX-512) | — |

> **Note:** SoquObscura supersedes the earlier Lattice-BP++ system (SOQ-P002). It uses ABDLOP commitments with LNP22/LaZer proofs and LaBRADOR block-level aggregation. The exactness architecture confines approximate proof slack (ψ) to non-consensus-critical margins via compile-time static asserts. Patent pending (SOQ-P010).

### ASIC Compatibility

Validated on **Antminer L7** (9.5 GH/s):
- Standard Stratum V1 protocol
- Zero firmware modifications
- Zero rejected shares across the validation run
- 640+ blocks continuous operation, zero crashes

### PAT (Practical Attestation Technique)

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented (v1.0) — November 2025

Soqucoin implements PAT to commit a batch of Dilithium signatures to a Merkle root. This gives a constant-size on-chain commitment for batch validation; the signatures themselves remain in witness data.

#### Implementation Details

| Component | Status | File |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Proof Generation | ✅ Complete | `CreateLogarithmicProof()` in `src/crypto/pat/logarithmic.cpp` |
| Proof Verification | ✅ Complete | `VerifyLogarithmicProof()` (proof, sibling path, tuples) |
| Simple Mode Verification | ✅ Production | `VerifyLogarithmicProof()` (proof, agg_pk, msg_root) |
| Full Mode Verification | ✅ Infrastructure Ready | Full witness validation |
| Consensus Opcode | ✅ Active | `OP_CHECKPATAGG` (0xfd) |
| Unit Tests | ✅ 26/26 Passing | `src/test/pat_tests.cpp` |
| Integration Tests | ✅ Complete | `src/test/pat_script_tests.cpp` |

#### Verification Guarantees

- ✅ **Merkle Root Binding**: Prevents proof forgery and signature omission
- ✅ **Hash Aggregation (SHA3-256)**: Prevents rogue-key substitution attacks  
- ✅ **Message Commitment**: Prevents message tampering or reordering
- ✅ **Non-Malleability**: Canonical ordering ensures unique proofs

#### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Proof Size | 100 bytes | Constant, regardless of batch size |
| Verification (Simple) | < 4 µs | O(1) constant time |
| Verification (Full) | ~800 µs @ n=1024 | O(log n) tree traversal |
| Commitment ratio | ~25,600× @ n=1024 | 100-byte commitment vs the raw signature bytes it commits; signatures remain in witness |
| Activation | Block 0 | Active since genesis |

#### Consensus Mode

```
Stack: <sigs...> <pks...> <msgs...> <count> 
       <proof> <agg_pk> <msg_root> OP_CHECKPATAGG
Use Case: Transaction validation, block verification
Trust Model: Full cryptographic verification with witness data
```

### Consensus Opcodes

| Opcode | Hex | Witness | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|----------|
| `OP_CHECKPATAGG` | 0xfd | v2 | PAT Merkle commitment verification |
| `OP_SOQUOBSCURA_RANGEPROOF` | 0xfa | v4 | SoquObscura range proof verification (deployment `NOT_SCHEDULED`) |

### Prover Implementation Status

| Component | Location | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **PAT Prover** | `src/crypto/pat/logarithmic.cpp` | ✅ In-tree |
| **PAT Verifier** | `src/crypto/pat/logarithmic.cpp` | ✅ In-tree |
| **SoquObscura disclosure + issuer registry** | `src/consensus/soquobscura/` | ◻ Scaffolding — headers only, deliberately not in the build |
| **SoquObscura Verifier** | _(planned; no path yet)_ | ◻ Not started — see note |
| **SoquObscura Prover** | _(planned; no path yet)_ | ◻ Not started |
| **LaBRADOR Aggregator** | _(planned; no path yet)_ | ◻ Not started |
| **PQ Wallet Library** | `src/wallet/pqwallet/` | ✅ In-tree |

Note: Lattice-BP++ (SOQ-P002) is superseded by SoquObscura (SOQ-P010). LatticeFold+ batch verification (`OP_CHECKFOLDPROOF`, witness v3) is deprecated. The opcode remains in the tree behind a deployment that does not activate on any network. It was reviewed in the April 2026 external extension audit. Its successor for confidential assets and succinct proofs is SoquObscura, a lattice-based confidential-asset system in research, whose deployment is not scheduled on any network and which is subject to the second external audit phase before any activation.

> ⛔ **Status note, so this table is not read as a claim of what exists.** Rows marked
> ◻ have **no code in this tree**. Earlier revisions of this table cited concrete paths
> (`src/crypto/soquobscura/`, `src/crypto/labrador/`) that have never existed; they are
> now marked as planned. Confidential outputs are **not active on any network** —
> `DEPLOYMENT_SOQUOBSCURA` is `NOT_SCHEDULED` on mainnet, testnet, regtest and stagenet
> — because the currently-shipped range verifier accepts an all-zero witness. See
> `src/test/soquobscura_degenerate_witness_tests.cpp`, whose three failing tests are
> committed red on purpose as the regression gate (zero witness, wire-reachable zero
> witness, and scaled witness; the scaled case staying red confirms the break is
> homogeneity-wide, so no "reject all zeros" patch can legitimately turn this battery
> green). Attribution for the LNP22/LaZer and
> LaBRADOR upstreams this work builds on is in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md).

### Branch Structure

| Branch | Purpose |
